# Final-Project: Library System
This program is an application for a library system. This was based on an UML diagram which was shown to us in class. The application is essentially a database for books and users. You are able to look up if a book is in the system, and if it is rented or unrented. There is of course, the ability to rent and unrent books. There is also a list of users that shows who is renting what books.
